"""The normalized model catalog.

Agent stages used to name a model as free text: ``"claude-sonnet-4-6"`` in one
place, ``"claude-sonnet-4-6-on-vertex"`` in another, a typo in a third. Nothing
told a Studio author which strings the engine actually routes, and nothing
stopped a stage naming one it does not.

A ``models`` collection makes that a reference rather than a spelling. The
document id is the ``model_id`` a stage stores, which is what turns "does this
model exist" into a lookup instead of a guess.

Two states are deliberately distinct:

* ``available`` -- Vertex offers it AND this deployment routes it. Selectable.
* ``not_enabled`` -- Vertex offers it, the engine does not route it here.
  Listed, shown disabled, and requestable. Hiding it would make the catalog
  look like the whole of what Vertex has, which is how someone concludes a
  model is unavailable when it is one config change away.

``retired`` exists so a model a stage already references can stop being
selectable without the reference dangling -- an old run's recorded model must
still resolve to something that explains what it was.
