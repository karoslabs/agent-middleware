"""FastAPI application entrypoint: wiring, lifespan management, exception handling.

The service is the **control plane** for the agent platform: the source of truth
in Firestore for agents, versioned system prompts, few-shot examples, content
templates (with their GCS asset bindings), runs and feedback.

It has exactly one outbound path — ``POST /agents/{agent_id}/jobs`` resolves an
agent's context, records a run, and publishes the payload to agent-engine's
topic. The engine is a stateless worker: everything it needs is in the message,
and it never reads this database.

There is deliberately no generic message-forwarding bridge. An earlier version
of this service relayed arbitrary Pub/Sub traffic between two topics (a pull
subscriber plus ``POST /pubsub/push``); that path knew nothing about agents,
recorded no run, and gave feedback nothing to attach to. Dispatch is the only
way a job reaches the engine, which is what keeps the run, the payload and the
message consistent by construction.
