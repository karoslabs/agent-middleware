"""Report which agent-engine workflows each client can actually run.

## Why this exists instead of a production ``--skeleton``

``seed_client_context.py --skeleton`` writes placeholders for everything an
agent refuses to start without, and it is refused against production on
purpose. The placeholder file says so itself::

    "Prep-only skeleton written by seed_client_context.py --skeleton so every
     agent can run without blocked_intake. Not real client configuration;
     never seed this into production."

The reason is worth restating, because "just seed the configs" is a natural
thing to ask for. The blocking values are *channel identities*: which X
account posts, which subreddits get replied to, which Instagram styling has
been approved, which shows a client holds the rights to clip. None of those is
derivable from anything in the portal -- the client record has no such fields
-- so seeding them means inventing them.

Inventing them does not fail safe. A ``blocked_intake`` is loud and harmless.
An agent configured with a guessed ``xHandle`` **succeeds**: it produces
finished drafts aimed at an account nobody verified, and hands them to a
reviewer with no signal that the target was made up. Prep's own skeleton
guesses ``targetSubreddits: ["r/test"]`` and derives ``xHandle`` from the
client slug, which is exactly the shape of that failure.

So this script reports the gap rather than papering over it. It answers "which
clients are ready, and for the ones that are not, what is a human actually
required to supply" -- and it names the mechanism that supplies each thing,
because for most of them one already exists.
