"""Project karosCMO's client records into the agent-engine workspace store.

agent-engine reads a client's onboarding data through the ``client.*`` tools,
which read one JSON record per key out of the workspace bucket::

    gs://<bucket>/clients/<slug>/client/profile.json
    gs://<bucket>/clients/<slug>/client/brand.json
    gs://<bucket>/clients/<slug>/client/voice-rules.json
    gs://<bucket>/clients/<slug>/client/config.json
    gs://<bucket>/clients/<slug>/client/competitors.json
    gs://<bucket>/clients/<slug>/context/<docType>.json

Production had none of these, so every production agent-engine run would stop
at ``blocked_intake`` before doing any work. This projects them from the three
places the data actually lives:

* **karosCMO Firestore** (``clients`` collection) -- the authoritative record
  a human edits in the portal: name, industry, website, branding guidelines,
  brand voice. Source for profile / brand / voice-rules.
* **an existing environment's ``config.json``** (``--carry-config-from``) --
  engine-specific settings that are not portal fields and cannot be derived
  from one: an X handle, a client's frozen Instagram style config. Carried
  forward rather than regenerated.

Nothing is invented on the default path. A client whose record has no industry
gets no ``industry`` key, not a guess. In particular this does NOT synthesise
``instagramStyleConfig``/``instagramBrandTokens``: instagram-agent refuses to
guess those and blocks the run instead, and a seeder that quietly invented
them would defeat exactly the check that exists to stop unreviewed styling
reaching a client's feed.

The last two paths are the C1 contract (``docs/contracts/C1-client-context.md``)
and they are the richer half. ``client/profile|brand|voice-rules`` are a handful
of fields off the client record -- one free-text voice line and some colours --
while ``context/<docType>.json`` carries the analyst-grade documents the
onboarding pipeline actually writes: brand voice, market strategy, competitor
analysis, product information, branding guidelines, target audience, and the
three per-agent identity profiles. Each is projected with full provenance
(which Firestore document, at which version, when, by which mechanism, and a
hash of the text) so ``report_client_readiness.py`` can say how stale the copy
an agent reads has become, rather than assuming it is current.

Only the ``internal`` tier is projected, and never with a fallback -- see
``PROJECTED_TIER``. And ``clientCompetitors`` fills the one path
``client.listCompetitors`` has always read and nothing has ever written.

``--skeleton`` is the exception, and it is refused against production for that
reason. It writes prep-only placeholders for everything an agent refuses to
start without, plus one record that is not per-agent at all::

    gs://<bucket>/clients/<slug>/topics/catalog.json

the no-repeat topic catalog every channel agent reserves a subject from.
NOTHING IN EITHER REPO EVER WRITES THAT FILE — ``topics.topUp`` has one
production caller (``topics.reserve``'s own proactive top-up) and it passes an
empty list — so it stays absent, reads as zero available rows, and every
``topics.reserve`` call breaches the lane floor forever. See
``skeleton_topics_catalog``.

Idempotent by content hash for the ``client/*`` records, and create-only for
the ``--skeleton`` extras: a record already present is never overwritten.
